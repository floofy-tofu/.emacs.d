#+title: Floofy Tofu's Emacs Config

* Info

The license is just to make github happy copy all you want and don't include the copyright
notice I really don't care this is an Emacs config.

This is a a complete restructuring of my Emacs configuration that I have tweeked since
2016 (which isn't that long considering how I know people at work who have used Emacs
longer than I have been alive).

Goals in mind I had for this
- Remove packages I don't use anymore; keep it relavant to what I use at work and in school
- Restructure into multiple files; I decided having everything in 1 literate org file
  actually made things less readable
- Navigate from [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] to
  [[https://github.com/progfolio/elpaca][elpaca]] because
  1. It's asynchronous installation is great because I no longer have to worry about what
     order =use-package= declarations are placed. For the most part, it just figures it
     all out for me.
  2. It's asynchronous installation is way faster.
  3. I can't do anything straight :3 üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

* Much Better Emacs Configs to +Plagiarize From+ Take Inspiration From

We all do it.

- Emacs from Scratch
- A pretty popular config online: https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d. the layout I thought
  was more readable than the typical literate org file and inspired me to switch. However,
  I use elpaca.
- The config of the Elpaca maintainer: https://github.com/progfolio/.emacs.d. I looked at
  this to learn Elpaca, and ended up taking the profile time hook functions instead.

* For the Future (for my sake)

** TODO Local ELPA

Add functionality to export the elpaca directory to a local ELPA directory.
- Some control to use the local ELPA instead of Elpaca
- Add ability to automatically rsync the ELPA to a list of remote hosts.
- Such is the fate of a hardware engineer who needs to work on specific physical hosts to
  access real physical hardware.

** TODO Spellcheck

One of
- Finish writing custom spellcheck
- Find a better 3rd party tool that doesn't slow everything down like flyspell-prog-mode
- Contribute to a 3rd party package to make it have the features I want. I remember once
  seeing some online but they only refreshed on buffer save; I would like it to refresh
  every few seconds on a timer.
